PHP-Extension-Bare-Framework
============================

This is a small skeleton framework for building php extensions that will be improved on and have more features slowly added.

##Usage

NOTE: I recommend you clone the source for PHP first, enter the `ext`
directory, then create a folder in there for extension code to go.
